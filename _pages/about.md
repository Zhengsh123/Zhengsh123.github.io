Shenghe Zheng is a second-year master degree candidate at the Department of Computer Science, Harbin Institute of Technology, fortunately advised by [Prof.Hongzhi Wang]( http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/wang). Previously, Shenghe Zheng obtained his Bachelor‚Äôs degree from Harbin Institute of Technology in June 2023.

His current research interests lie in Large Language Models, Multimodal Models, Efficient AI, and Neural Architecture Search(NAS). Currently, he is interning at the Shanghai AI Lab, conducting research related to large language models under the guidance of Dr. Peng Ye, and collaborating closely with [Dr. Ganqu Cui](https://cgq15.github.io/). If you are seeking any form of academic cooperation, please feel free to email at [shenghez.zheng@gmail.com](shenghez.zheng@gmail.com).

[FREE-Merging: Fourier Transform for Model Merging with Lightweight Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16815)

**Shenghe Zheng**, Hongzhi Wang, 

-  We find that task-specific information from fine-tuning harms Model Merging, so we use frequency-domain filtering to reduce conflicts and utilize lightweight experts to compensate for information loss during model merging.

[Decouple and Orthogonalize: A Data-Free Framework for LoRA Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15875)

**Shenghe Zheng**, Hongzhi Wang, Chenyu Huang, Xiaohui Wang, Tao Chen, Jiayuan Fan, Shuyue Hu, Peng Ye

-  We find that existing model merging methods are ineffective for LoRA due to large parameter magnitude differences. We propose a decoupling approach and optimize it via data-free orthogonalization.
